# Life & Reliability Enhancement of Furnace Walking Beam Tie Rod

This project focuses on enhancing the life and reliability of the **furnace walking beam tie rod** at Tata Steel’s New Bar Mill. Following a critical failure that caused significant operational disruptions, this study involved root cause analysis, design verification, and the development of real-time monitoring solutions to prevent future failures.

## Project Overview

The primary objective of this project was to:
- Analyze the root causes of the tie rod failure.
- Address the synchronization issues in the hydraulic system.
- Implement real-time monitoring and predictive maintenance solutions to enhance reliability.

### Key Areas of Study

1. **Tie Rod Failure**:
   - **Finite Element Analysis (FEA)** was conducted to evaluate stress distribution and identify critical areas of concern, particularly in the tie rod welding joints. Welding defects were identified as a major contributor to premature failures.

2. **Hydraulic System Delays**:
   - Issues in the hydraulic system, specifically unsynchronized lifting of the cylinders, caused billet misalignment, leading to delays in production.

3. **Furnace Health Index (FHI)**:
   - A real-time **Furnace Health Index** (FHI) was developed to monitor critical parameters such as tie rod strain, hydraulic pressure differences, laser alignment, and billet temperature.

## Recommendations

1. **Welding Improvements**:
   - **Welding Procedure Specification (WPS)** was implemented to ensure higher welding quality, reducing the risk of future tie rod failures.
   - Regular **Phased Array Ultrasonic Testing (PAUT)** was recommended for early detection of potential welding defects.

2. **Hydraulic System Enhancements**:
   - A **Master Cylinder** was recommended to ensure synchronized lifting of hydraulic cylinders, reducing billet misalignment.
   - **Mechanical Guideways** were proposed to constrain the lifting frame’s movement and prevent deviations.

3. **Furnace Health Index (FHI)**:
   - The **FHI** monitors key furnace parameters:
     - **Tie Rod Strain**: Real-time monitoring of tie rod strain to predict potential failures.
     - **Hydraulic Pressure**: Monitoring pressure differences between cylinders to detect desynchronization.
     - **Laser Alignment**: Tracking billet alignment to avoid skewness in the furnace.
     - **Billet Temperature**: Monitoring billet temperature to ensure optimal heating.
   - **Real-time Monitoring**: Recommended to host on an online server, FHI provides real-time tracking with alarms for exceeded thresholds.
   - **Predictive Maintenance**: Historical FHI data is used to predict future failures, enabling preventive maintenance.

4. **Vibrational Analysis**:
   - Regular **Motion Amplification Studies** to detect vibrations at critical points such as the tie rod and lever joints.
   - Strengthening the base structure and conducting ultrasonic testing on concrete as needed.

5. **Additional Monitoring and Testing**:
   - **Real-time Stress and Strain Mapping**: Monitoring tie rod stress using strain gauges.
   - Regular **PAUT** testing for detecting mechanical defects.

## Conclusion

The **Life & Reliability Enhancement of Furnace Walking Beam Tie Rod** project successfully identified the causes of failure and proposed technical improvements. The introduction of the **Furnace Health Index (FHI)**, welding improvements, and hydraulic system enhancements are expected to significantly reduce downtime and prevent future failures, ensuring optimal furnace performance.
